    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey, I’m Ketan Thakur — a second-year Computer Science student at VIT-AP, currently pursuing a 5-year Integrated B.Tech + M.Tech degree. But more than what I’m studying, this journey is about who I’m becoming — and the road to this point has been anything but straight.</p>

    <p>I didn’t grow up in a house filled with gadgets or coding conversations. Tech wasn’t my starting line. I come from a place where discipline meant waking up before sunrise, physical strength was valued above all, and dreams often wore a soldier's uniform. For the longest time, my biggest goal was to get into the NDA. That’s what I trained for — physically, mentally, emotionally. And when that dream didn’t work out, it hit hard. But failure, I’ve learned, doesn’t mean the end — sometimes it just redirects you to something you never saw coming.</p>

    <p>I found myself stepping into the world of technology, not with excitement at first, but with uncertainty. I had no idea what I was doing. But I decided to treat it the same way I treated my NDA prep — with discipline, consistency, and heart. I began exploring Java, Python, DSA, and problem-solving — brick by brick. There were times I felt behind, out of place, or lost. But I kept showing up. And now, slowly, I’m building not just knowledge, but confidence — in my work, in my journey, in myself.</p>

    <p>Beyond the classroom and the code, fitness remains a big part of who I am. It’s not just about building muscle — it’s about showing up for myself, even on the days when I don’t feel like it. That gym grind, the soreness, the discipline — it reminds me of where I started and where I still want to go. And yeah — nothing feels quite like walking on a broken ankle, not because it’s smart, but because it reminds me I’ve still got that fight in me. That voice inside that says, “Keep going.”</p>

    <p>And then there’s the part of me that writes. Poetry. Shayari. Stories. Emotions I can’t say out loud but spill perfectly in words. My Instagram page @kt4nwrites is my quiet corner of the world where I post pieces of my heart. Sometimes people read them and say, “I felt that.” And honestly, that means more to me than likes or followers ever could.</p>

    <p>I don’t claim to have it all figured out. I’m not the top coder in my batch or the fittest guy in the gym. But I try. Every single day. I try to be a little better, a little wiser, a little more patient with myself and the process. I believe in becoming good at many things — not chasing perfection, but progress.</p>

    <p>I’ve always felt like I live in two worlds — one where I’m chasing tech dreams, coding problems, and building a future… and another where I’m just a guy from Himachal, who once dreamt of the NDA, still hits the gym every evening, and writes poetry late into the night. And I guess I’m learning that both versions of me are real — and valid.</p>

    <p>So if you’re here, reading this, maybe we’ve got something in common. Or maybe you’re just curious. Either way — I’m glad you’re here. I’m open to new projects, collaborations, conversations, or just honest connections — whether it’s about tech, fitness, poetry, or figuring out life one day at a time.</p>

    <p>Let’s build something — or at least have a real talk.</p>
